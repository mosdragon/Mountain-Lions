This project was created to compete in the 2012 WebChallenge by TAG-Ed of Georgia. The site is hosted on a free server at http://aadvance.zzl.org/ , however the server is often unresponsive, so the files will be uploaded to github.

This site was created using a template purchased by my web design teacher in high school, and my teammate Viet Dang and I authored the site. The images used have mostly been given small touch ups by Viet using Adobe Photoshop. I was mainly responsible for creating the pages and the accompanying CSS to enhance it. 

Our team name was "Mountain Lions" and we created this project as "AAdvance." We ultimately won 1st place in Georgia for the Judges Prize category and were among the top 11 teams of the state, with our award ceremony at Cisco's facility in Lawrenceville, Georgia.

--Note, this project was completed in February of 2012
